# Molecular dynamics

This project is for the Cimulation and Modeling course of the Summer
2025 semester in Uni Koln.

## TO-DO

 - [x] Setup
 - [ ] Newton's equations
 - [ ] Random configuration with sufficient particles
 - [ ] Implement damping
 - [ ] Try different time steps
 - [ ] Check energy conservation
 - [ ] Analyze floating point efficiency
 - [ ] Describe formal scaling wrt N
 - [ ] Improvement based on sparse systems?

## Design decisions:

 - Poetry for project management
 - Animations of dynamics
 - Slide flow (bottom-up):
   - Single particle dynamics
   - Symplectic schemes
   - Scaling to multiple particles

## Setup

To replicate results

 1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
 2. Clone the repo
 3. `$ poetry install`
 4. `python simulation.py`
